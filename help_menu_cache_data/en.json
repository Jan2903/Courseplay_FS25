mower or harvester from before.\nAnother big feature is the collecting or wrapping of bales on the field.\nCourseplay is also able to work on rice fields and vines.\nFieldwork courses can be setup in multitool mode, which allows the use of up to 5 driver working in a convoy on the same field.\nIt's also possible to have the combine unload in a trailer on/near the field automatically.\nCustom field borders can be assigned for Courseplay to use, for example: in case of a meadow, which isn't recognised as a normal field.\nLastly CP has an interface for AutoDrive, which allows for refilling of a seeder at a nearby silo or unloading a forage wagon and so on.\nCombine unloaders are able to create a heap near the field with their loaded fruit.\nIn Farming Simulator 25, Courseplay got its own menu, which you can access over different buttons on the HUD.\n\nFor more information please visit our GitHub: https://github.com/Courseplay/Courseplay_FS25 .\nThere you can get help or report any

This setting has an impact on the overall course.\n- Number of headlands: The best way to keep your vehicles on the field while turning at the end of each row is to add headlands.\nThe Number of the Headlands multiplied by the work width should be at least the total length of your vehicle plus the attached tool.\n- Start work on: As mentioned in the extended AI Menu, the field position is used to set the start or end position for the fieldwork course.\nYou want to start working on the headland when harvesting, and work towards the middle of the field.\nPlowing, sowing and cultivating should start in the center of the field and work towards the headland.\n", "CP_help_page_courseGeneratorHeadland_text": "\nHeadland settings will only show up when you have set at least one headland.\nYou'll have options for where to start on, corner settings, direction and overlap.\nHeadlands are highly recommended to prevent tools leaving the field when turning.\n", "CP_help_page_courseGeneratorHeadlandFunctions_text": "\n- Sharpen headland corners: Sharpen the corners of the headlands which are not rounded. Will force the vehicle to make a headland turn whenever the headland's curvature is less than the turning radius of the vehicle.\n- Number of round corners: Number of headlands, counting from the outermost one, that will have rounded corners. Rounded corners are based on the vehicle's turning radius, so for these headlands, the vehicle won't perform a turn maneuver in the corners.\n- Corner radius: Sets the radius for the round corners. If you know a following work tool have a minimum radius of 10, you may set this value to 10 for the course.\n- Headland direction: clockwise or counter-clockwise. This can be important for combines and harvesters, depending on which side the pipe or conveyor belt is.\n- Headland overlap: How much one headland overlaps with the next. This is to avoid missing fruit in some cases.\n- Field Margin: Positive values reduce field size to add a buffer around the worked area in case you have obstacles near the field border.\nNegative values enlarge worked area beyond the field boundary to cover up field borders that are not perfectly detected.\n", "CP_help_page_courseGeneratorCenter_text": "\nThe generator provides several different patterns to generate the course for the center of the field. The best pattern is usually determined by the job and the implements selected. The patterns were created based on feedback and information from our community.\nThe simple up down pattern works almost every time for any tool. \nOther patterns may improve efficiency, such as using the Lands pattern when harvesting with a combine will keep the pipe out of the fruit for a more faster unloading.\nFor choppers, racetrack can be a better choice for wider turns to make the work of the unloader easier.\nSpiral is a best for towed harvesters with an offset to keep the tool in the fruit and the tractor outside.\n", "CP_help_page_courseGeneratorCenterFunctions_text": "\n- Field center: There are different modes on how your field center pattern should look like. The classic and most used one is up/down.\nSpiral, racetrack and lands have their own specific advantages over the others. Lands for example will have the combine's pipe point out of the fruit most of the time to easier unload them.\n- Center direction: For the spiral and lands patterns you can set the direction, similar to the headland direction.\n- Even row width: If the center of a field have a total width that can't evenly be split over the work width of the tool, the first or last row will be narrower. You can use this setting to prevent this and make each row the same width (which will be less than the working width).\n- Row direction: automatic mostly finds the best direction, but sometimes the longest edge fits better. If you are not happy with either one, choose manual and set the direction manually.\n- Row angle: When the row direction is set to manual, this setting appears and will tell the generator the direction of the rows.\n\nThese settings appear only for specific settings you have done before:\n\n- Rows to skip: Appears when field center is set to \"up/down\". This is a very helpful option to accelerate your work, as vehicles can make wider turns and won't have to reverse when turning into the next row.\n- Rows per land: Appears when field center is set to \"lands\". This has only impact when the field center is set to lands and will tell the generator how many rows each land should have. The more rows, the fewer lands will be generated.\n- Spiral from inside: Appears when field center is set to \"spiral\".\n- Number of circles: Appears when field center is set to \"racetrack\".\n", "CP_help_page_courseGeneratorCenterExampleUpdown_text": "\nup/down\n", "CP_help_page_courseGeneratorCenterExampleLands_text": "\nlands\n", "CP_help_page_courseGeneratorCenterExampleSpiral_text": "\nspiral\n", "CP_help_page_courseGeneratorCenterExampleRacetrack_text": "\nracetrack\n", "CP_help_page_courseGeneratorIsland_text": "\nCourseplay will generate headlands around islands when island bypass is enabled, so when the course first encounters an island, it will make at least one full circle around it.\nYou can set the number of headlands (thus the number of circles) around the island if you need more room for vehicles turning at the island.\nKeep in mind that the generator may decide to generate fewer headlands if the island is too close to the field boundary.\n", "CP_help_page_courseGeneratorIslandFunctions_text": "\n- Island bypass: Turns on or off the bypass of the island, if an island is found. This does not work for custom fields!\n- Island headlands: The number of rounds around the island can be set independently of the headland setting.\n- Island headland direction: In which direction the driver drives around the island, for instance, to make sure the combine's pipe is not in the fruit or to not have strange direction changes.\n", "CP_help_page_courseGeneratorExpert_text": "\nSome settings are only visible, if you set the expert mode to active on the global Courseplay settings.\nBefore you play around with those settings, you should make sure you know what the basic settings do.\nSome expert settings only work properly under some conditions.\n\n- Multiple tools: This setting is used when you want more than just one vehicle to work on your course. As this gets a bit more complicated, there is a separate help topic for it.\n- Switching lanes: With this option active, vehicles switch lanes at each turn, so every vehicle's turn is of the same width. See the extra help menu \"Switching lanes\" for more details.\n- Narrow field: Creates the headland only at two short edges of the field. In that case, it is not possible to keep your vehicle on the field on the longest edges at the headland.\n- Headland overlap: By default, headland passes overlap each other (but never the field edge) by a few percent to avoid missing fruit in some edge cases. You can change that overlap here.\n- Field margin: This setting lets you move the field border in- or outwards of the original border.\n- Use base line edge: With this setting you can generate curved up/down rows, running parallel with the edge of the field near the field marker. This makes sense when the field edge is not straight, the up/down rows will follow the curve of the edge.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This is an experimental setting which may not work for all field shapes.
